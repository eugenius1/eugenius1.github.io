My name is Eusebius Ngemera. I have the following qualities:

- I survived chicken pox at the age of 17
- I name Python as my favourite programming language

What else do you need?


# *Eusebius* Pronounciation

Usually it's pronounced [yoo-SEE-bee-əs] but I am the exception [yoo-SAY-bee-əs], which adds an accent: **Eusébius**.
