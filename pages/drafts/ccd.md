Cryptocurrency (crypto) is an asset class that most people haven't yet truly understood.
They are new and complex but also have a lot of potential to forever transform the world,
much like the internet has done.
To explain crypto, I have to explain Bitcoin,
and to explain Bitcoin, I have to explain commodities.

I have owned cryptocurrencies since 2018 because I saw their potential.
I started mindfully investing in 2020
and started truly understanding them in 2021.

## Part 1 recap

If you haven't already, I highly recommend reading [_Part 1: The Awakening_](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/)
of my investing blog series before reading this article.
Seriously, go scroll through my **7 key points before investing**.

> "I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. **Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.**"  
> — Warren Buffett (one of the greatest investors of all time)

The section on [**Mindset**](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#mindset) is really important
and even more so for crypto which is highly volatile.
Crypto today has a lot of both **greed and fear spread around**,
by both individuals and institutions.
It's important to not follow either of these extreme emotions and instead stay logical.

According to my **financial goals** and **risk appetite**,
I target commodities to be 10% of my investment portfolio and crypto to be 15%.
I primarily buy these assets on [Trading212](https://www.trading212.com/invite/FMqHiTlg)
and [Binance](https://guy.coinbureau.com/binance/) (both are special links with perks).
I explained why these were the best options for me in the section
[Broker/Exchange](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#brokerexchange).

| Asset Class     | Target Allocation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Stocks          |             60%   |
| Bonds           |             15%   |
| **Commodities** |           **10%** |
| **Crypto**      |           **15%** |

## Commodities

> A commodity is a **basic good used in commerce** that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type.  
> — [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)

As an asset class, commodities may provide one or both of these benefits:

- **Inflation hedge**: to grow with inflation in the long run.
The idea here is that the price of basic goods needed for daily life tend to move up with inflation.
- **Decorrelation**: to diversify a portfolio by providing relatively low correlation to other asset classes (e.g. stocks, bonds).

Let's see what commodities are available on Trading212:

### Performance comparison

Let's take these commodity types and see how they've performed historically.
Below is how they've performed in percentage terms from 2008 to 2021.
I've include gold, a classic commodity, as well as S&P 500 Index (SPX), a common reference of the stock market.
Prices of goods in the US inflated by around [28.5%](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) from 2008 to 2021.

{:.small}

What we see first is that all commodity types have underperformed the stock market at least since 2018 with the exception of DH2O that is roughly on par.
DH2O is made up of **water** companies' stocks so it makes sense for it be performing as well as the stock market and highly correlated.
Some may argue that DH2O should only count as a stock ETF and not a commodity ETF
but I think water is a very important, daily basic good whose value shouldn't be ignored.

Second best performing type was precious metals (VZLE).
Gold is part of this index ETF but because gold underperforms,
it means there is at least one other precious metal that has performed better.
What is also noteworthy is that precious metals (and in particular gold) demonstrated **decorrelation** to the stock market by staying strong during the **crashes** of [2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)
and [early 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash).
Investors have typically switched from stocks to inflation hedges like gold when the economy is uncertain and vice versa.

After gold comes carbon then industrial metals which performed just under US inflation.
The other commodity types (agriculture, livestock, petroleum and fossil fuels) have lost significant value,
with fossil fuels having lost 82% not accounting for inflation in the 13 years!
Ethically, I don't believe in a future for fossil fuels and their performance as assets really cements that in.
DJP, a commodity index, has also lost significant value and checking today's composition shows 72% is in fossil fuels, agriculture and livestock.

Now let's see the 4 precious metals since 1997 (oldest data I could get for palladium & platinum):

![Performance of the 4 precious metals 1997-2021: gold, silver, palladium, platinum](/raw/img/blog/2021/investing/commodities/precious-metals-1997-2021.png)
{:.small}
{:.text-center}

First obvious thing is that palladium has vastly outperformed the other assets including stocks and particularly since 2017.
[Palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium) is mostly used in [catalytic converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter) which convert toxic pollutants in exhaust gases from internal combustion engines into less toxic pollutants.
From what I've gathered, the price jump is due to [lacking supply](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/palladium-investing/palladium-outlook/) and speculation.
This brings us to a very common law in economics.

[**Law of supply and demand**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp):
This theory says that the **quantity and price** of something in a market (e.g. financial assets, food, electricity)
moves towards an equilibrium where **supply and demand are matched**.
In palladium's case the supply reduced and assuming the demand didn't change much, the price went up.
Inversely, if the supply goes up while the demand doesn't change, the price goes down.
Conversely, the price follows the direction of demand if the supply remains unchanged.
So decreased supply and unchanged demand leads to higher prices which leads to both lower demand and an increase in supply (producing or just selling becomes more profitable) and so on until an equilibrium of supply & demand.

Another thing to note is the presence of **market cycles**.
For example, palladium peaked in 2001 and all others in 2011 during the [2000s commodities boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_commodities_boom).
From this time perspective (24 years), 3 out of the 4 precious metals have outperformed stocks but some of them with a lot of **volatility** along the way.
Gold seems to be the least volatile while delivering the second best performance after palladium.

### Types of money

[**Gold standard**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp):
For several millennia, this shiny metal has been used both as a monetary unit to trade goods & services (along with silver)
and as a store of value & wealth.
We transitioned to paper money that was backed by gold (most commonly) or silver.
However, [the Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp) of the 1930s led to countries starting to drop the gold standard.
Countries that dropped it earlier [recovered quicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Gold_standard).
With the gold standard, inflation can be avoided but strict commitment to it can create economic instability.

<!-- > "We have gold because we **cannot trust governments**."  
> &mdash; President Herbert Hoover in his 1933 statement to Franklin D. Roosevelt (successor) -->

[**Fiat money**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp):
"fiat" is a Latin word often translated as "it shall be".
With the gold standard dropped, paper money today has **no intrinsic value** as no precious metals back it.
Through supply & demand, the value of fiat money comes entirely from the **trust** that we people put on it because a government or its central bank issued it.

A major benefit of fiat money is that it gives central banks great control over the economy as they control money's supply.
For example, supply is usually increased by ["printing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money#Money_creation_and_regulation) more money and it can be decreased by increasing interest rates so more money is saved and less circulates.

However, fiat money is not a bulletproof way of protecting the economy as it can lead to severe inflation and even [hyperinflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp) (over 50% per month) that usually leads to the country switching from their local fiat currency to a foreign one.
Recent examples include [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) and [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela) (ongoing as of 2021).
This not to say that severe and hyperinflation are only caused by using fiat money as summarised on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp):

> It is unclear whether or not hyperinflations are caused by "runaway printing" of money. In fact, hyperinflations have occurred throughout history, even when money was based on precious metals; and all contemporary hyperinflations have begun with a fundamental breakdown in the real **production economy** and/or **political instability** in the country.

On the other side, low inflation can be seen as a positive for economic growth as it encourages people to put their money to work to avoid losing purchasing power over time.

### Stock-to-flow

In the thousands of years of history, why has gold held value consistently?
The answer is scarcity, at least on Earth.
Today the amount of gold already mined is much more than the yearly production which results in its price not changing much due to changes in yearly production.
This means that the price of gold is mainly affected by changes in human sentiment, which affects market supply and demand.

To demonstrate the relationship between scarcity and market value of an asset,
we need to be able to quantify scarcity.
Economics professor [Dr. Saifedean Ammous](https://books.google.fr/books/about/The_Bitcoin_Standard.html?id=wf9QDwAAQBAJ) talks about scarcity in terms of of **stock-to-flow ratio** (SF) where stock is the size of the existing stockpiles and flow is the yearly production:

> SF = stock / flow

A former institutional investor with the pseudonym PlanB wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) including the table below with the 4 precious metals and their stock-to-flow ratios:

<!-- TODO: convert to text -->
![2019 stock-to-flow data of the 4 precious metals: gold, silver, palladium, platinum](/raw/img/blog/2021/investing/commodities/precious-metals-stock-to-flow.png)
{:.small}
{:.text-center}

As of 2019, gold had the highest stock-to-flow ratio of the precious metals at 62.
In other words, it would takes 62 years of production to double the amount of gold above ground.
For palladium that number was only 1.1 years.
Commodities with higher SF ratios are less affected by changes in production and have lower [price elasticity of supply](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-does-price-elasticity-affect-supply.asp).
This explains gold's low price volatility amongst the precious metals.

These SF ratios may not significantly increase anytime soon as PlanB explains in the same article:

> It is almost impossible for commodities to get a higher SF, because as soon as somebody hoards them, price rises, production rises, and price falls again. It is very hard to escape this trap.

What if there was a scarce commodity like gold that you could easily transport via a medium like the internet?
