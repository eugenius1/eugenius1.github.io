**Remember** to put this in /drafts/

**<abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>**: I had a pretty good experience and got money that covered my lacking student finance. I found out about the world of clinical trials and what to anticipate as a volunteer. I discovered a bit more about my own body.

---

Last month, I successfully completed 8 weeks after being injected with a single dose of a study drug. This is the first brief I received before getting screened:

> The study drug being developed in this study is a compound called benralizumab for the **treatment of asthma**. This is a first time into man study. This study consists of **1 night in–house and 9 outpatients visits**. We are looking for **healthy male** volunteers (aged 18-55). Volunteers must be non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to screening. The inconvenience allowance for this study is **£1,700**.

But before we get started, let me take you back to how I got into clinical trials.


# Missed opportunity

In the Spring of 2016, I saw an advert on a train in the <abbr title="London Underground">tube</abbr> for Quintiles who were looking for paid volunteers for some studies. I was interested and so I went online to register to be screened for a [trial for M923](http://www.studyforchange.com/wp-content/uploads/5062-QXA79805-IC-Ver-5-dated-07-Mar-2016.pdf). The study drug, M923, has potential for treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. The trial would involve 2 nights stay and 13 outpatient visits before getting **£2,910**!

Some time later, I was invited for a screening and accepted to the trial subject to my <abbr title="General Practice">GP</abbr> sending my medical summary to Quintiles in time. This didn't happen. I had a good healthcare experience from my GP surgery at that time, Farnham Road Practice in Slough, but they have been poorly let down by very slow admin processing.

Fast-forward past this missed opportunity, I had a look at some other drug research units and subscribed to Parexel's email and SMS notifications. The table below is a 7-month summary of trials available before I chose one.

# Study details

The trial I was part of is study 230172 run by [Parexel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAREXEL) and sponsored by [AstraZeneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca), the drug developer ([1](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02968914))([2](https://www.smartpatients.com/trials/NCT02968914)). I was given a 19-page document with participant information and a consent document. Up to 180 participants will take part in this study. The study is also being run at another study centre in Germany

**Simplified Study Title:**

> **A Study in Healthy Volunteers to Compare the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion of Benralizumab when Administered using 2 Different Devices**

Full Study Title:

> A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Parallel Group Phase 1 Pharmocokenetic Comparability Study of Benralizumab Administered using Accessorized Pre-Filled Syringe (APFS) or Autoinjector (AI) in Healthy volunteers

The **main purpose** of the study is to compare how much of the drug is taken up, its distribution, how the drug is broken down and removed from the body when administered through the 2 different devices mentioned above. Another purpose is to see how safe it is, how well it is tolerated and if it causes an immune response (anti-drug antibodies).

The trial took 17 weeks from the overnight stay to the last outpatient visit, with my screening being the week before the start. Volunteers are free to leave the study at any time and without any reason.

## Safety

> The efficacy and safety of benralizumab has been shown in **two large clinical trials** in patients that suffer from asthma.

That's what was mentioned in the information document and is supported by [other sources](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3206982-astrazenecas-benralizumab-reduces-asthma-exacerbations-51-percent-two-late-state-studies). More than **2,000 patients** received benralizumab and it was shown that the drug reduces asthma exacerbations by up to 51% in two late-state studies.


# Screening

Before getting screened, there are some requirements I had to meet before going in:

- **fast** from food & drink (except water) for 8 hours before
- no **alcohol** 72 hours before
- no foods with **poppy seeds** 72 hours before and throughout the trial
- not taken part in **a study** in the 3 months prior
- no history of drinking more than 21 units of **alcohol** per week in the 12 weeks prior
- not donated one or or more units nor had any other significant **loss of blood** in the 3 months prior
- not donated plasma in the 1 month prior

Fasting for 8 hours is not unreasonable, even more so considering screening and outpatients are usually in the mornings.

Screening took about 2 hours or so and it was their way of assessing me for the requirements of the trial. I was in a small group with other volunteers screening when a study doctor talked to us in more detail. We then signed the consent form after getting the chance to ask questions. I answered a questionaire (smoking habits, alcohol consumption and such) before going through some physical assessments and sample collections:

- Physical examination, including height and weight for calculating Body Mass Index
- Urine sample
- [Electrocardiogram](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/electrocardiogram/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (ECG)
- Blood pressure
- Blood samples (~97 mL)

To put 97 mL of blood into perspective, 470 mL is given in a single donation at the Blood Transfusion Service. The trial's maximum volume taken doesn't exceed 470 mL. For this cohort of the study, my weight had to be strictly between 55.0 and 69.9 kg.

I got dates for my overnight stay and outpatient visits during my screening and were part of the agreement to sign. 
After successful screening, Parexel sent a request to my GP for my medical history. I had to pay my GP surgery for this to be sent but Parexel reimbursed me.


# In-house stay

There is some restriction on what can be brought in before going in, mostly to stop external food and drink. Inside we got set meals which were really good; I have no complaints. Weirdly enough, everyone gets vegetarian meals on their first day. The first day and night of standardised meals prepared us to a baseline state, so to speak, before dosing.

My cohort was the first for the study, at least in the UK. There were 5 of us and in the same ward. I was the youngest, at 21, with the other 4 men being in their 30s and one in his 40s. The eldest man told me that he has been doing one trial per year for about a decade!

more men than women. Women who do are mostly post child bearing age.

man got ill, bed-ridden. His food was brought to his bed

In the morning, one of my cohort would be sent home as they are a reserve until the rest get dosed. 1 in 5 people end up being a reserve and the choice is usually based on medical test results. This reserve can go straight to be screened for another trial or the same trial but for another day. The reserve is paid for their time, **£225**.

The study drug was injected with a random choice between the two devices and also randomly chosen into either left or right, of either the upper arm, abdomen or thigh. I got left upper arm and didn't feel much of a sting at all; blood sample injections had more of a sting.

vital signs measured, ECG

We were given yellow cards to have on us at all times to present to any medical staff or use one of the phone numbers to reach the study doctor.


# Restrictions

Any restrictions I list here should only be taken as examples since generally they'll vary between different trials and different research units. My restrictions during the trial, mostly until the last visit:

- no **medication** from 14 days before admission until the last visit, unless regular and prescribed
- **only Paracetamol** for relief of pain and fever and after the Study Doctor's approval
- no more than 2 units of **alcohol** per day
- no more than 3 cups of **caffeine** per day (1 cup = 250 mL of soda, 180 mL of coffee or 240 mL of tea)
- no **high-energy drinks**, such as Red Bull
- no foods with **poppy seeds**
- no **nicotine**-containing products, such as tobacco and nicotine plasters
- not donate **blood or plasma** until 3 months after the last visit
- as a **male**, use a barrier contraception and not donate sperm until 4 months after the last visit
- **females** would need to have a negative pregnancy test, not be breastfeeding and must be unable to have children (eg. age reasons)

The poppy seed restriction meant missing my beloved [seeded bread](http://www.warburtons.co.uk/products/bread/seeded/400g-seeded-batch-five-seeds) for 17 weeks or so. Other than that, my non-smoking, non-binge drinking habits and lack of caffeine had prepared me well for this trial's "restrictions".
