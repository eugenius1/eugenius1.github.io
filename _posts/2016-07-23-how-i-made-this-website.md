title: How I made this website!

**TL;DR**: Domain name from [hover.com](https://hover.com/Yiflhr2y), free hosting through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [*Beautiful Jekyll*](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/ "beautiful-jekyll homepage") theme by Dean Attali.

# Website domain name

I had to choose a website domain name that I could spell out in a few seconds yet you could remember after some months or even years. Shortness vs Reliability. There were three contenders and in the end I settled on the middle ground and that's `eusebius.tech`. This domain name just has my first name and I like that the extension captures my techie personality.

[hover.com](https://hover.com/Yiflhr2y)
Other registrars exist but I chose hover because of the value, especially considering they offer free Whois privacy.

# Hosting

Before eusebius.tech, I was hosting a simpler website through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at [eugenius1.github.io](http://eugenius1.github.io) (which now links to this domain). GitHub Pages can host a static website from a repository as well as project pages such as [this](http://eusebius.tech/ee3-rtdsp/ "EE3: Real-Time Digital Signal Processing"). A static website is like a folder containing fully-rendered contents, whereas a dynamic website is like a program which runs on a server and produces content when you make a request.

The beauty of GitHub Pages is that I can have my website hosted, for free, at a custom domain. This is true freedom, taking my website name from `eugenius1.github.io` to a much more friendly `eusebius.tech`. One downside is that I lose https as I now would have to implement a secure connection myself instead of GitHub.
