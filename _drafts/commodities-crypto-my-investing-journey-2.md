## Commodities

Gold is scarce (but at least on Earth)

### Stock to flow

[Stock-to-Flow model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)

High S2F are less susceptible to swings in supply;
price is inelastic to supply.

FDR took USD (and others) off the gold standard.

### Bitcoin as digital gold

S2F:
_The Bitcoin Standard_ book by S. Ammous

[Review of S2F model for Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/jfjjWAmGks4)

Immutable distributed ledger.
Immutable: really hard to change, basically there forever;
Distributed: no single computer can decide, but a network of computers;
Ledger: table of information.
Powered by cryptography

- decentralised
- resistant to censorship
- trustless
- permissionless

most secure payment method.
History forever there.

Economics and relatively slow transaction speed & throughput

## Crypto

### Background

Ethereum:
Turing-complete virtual network that runs applications and stores information on a blockchain.
Turing-completeness means anything is programmable.

Smart contracts are not really contracts but pieces of code that codify business logic, at the core they:

- store rules
- verify rules
- execute rules



Web 3.0

The blockchain Trilemma [Vitalik Buterin]:

- Security
- Decentralisation
- Scalability

Decentralisation:

- Architectural
- Political
- Logical (not blockchains, i.e. logic is common)

Benefits:

- Fault tolerance
- Attack resistance
- Collusion resistance (political?)

Smart Contracts:

1. Security
2. Guaranteed execution
3. Transparency
4. Trust minimisation
5. Efficiency

Paper guarantee (brand based) vs cryptographic guarantee (math based)

Eth 2.0:

- PoS and reduced tranaction (gas) fees
- sharding for scalability

Issuance of new ETH will reduce from 4.5% to 0.5-0.8% an together with EIP-1559 (burning of most gas fees) will likely result in ETH becoming deflationary.

Reduced volatility of BTC and ETH over time as more utility from people and institutions using the respective blockchains.
