Move fast and break things, unless you're breaking things you're not moving fast enough.

If I get rejected, it's not that I have failed but that I have tried

Don't wait, the time will never be just right.

If you want something you've never had, you need to do something you've never done before

Build doors and bring value

Where there's resistance, there's growth

Always do something you're a little not ready to do

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?

Begin with the end in mind

surrounding yourself with people who elevate and inspire you

go alone go fast, go together go far

See the world not as it is but as it should be

Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us bigger, even though sometimes it is hard to realize this. For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward.  
Henry Ford

Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving
Einstein

Don't wait, the time will never be just right.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto  
Luke 6:31


Live. Laugh. Learn. Love
