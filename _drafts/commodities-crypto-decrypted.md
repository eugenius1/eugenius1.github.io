title: "Commodities & Crypto—Decrypted! | MIJ Pt 2"
subtitle: A software engineer's investing thesis. No dogs.

Cryptocurrency (crypto) is an asset class that most people haven't yet truly understood.
They are new and complex but also have a lot of potential to forever transform the world,
much like the internet has done.
To explain crypto, I have to explain Bitcoin,
and to explain Bitcoin, I have to explain commodities.

I have owned cryptocurrencies since 2018 because I saw their potential.
I started mindfully investing in 2020
and started truly understanding them in 2021.

## Part 1 recap

If you haven't already, I highly recommend reading [_Part 1: The Awakening_](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/)
of my investing blog series before reading this article.
Seriously, go scroll through my **7 key points before investing**.

> "I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. **Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.**"  
> — Warren Buffett (one of the greatest investors of all time)

The section on [**Mindset**](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#mindset) is really important
and even more so for crypto which is highly volatile.
Crypto today has a lot of both **greed and fear spread around**,
by both individuals and institutions.
It's important to not follow either of these extreme emotions and instead stay logical.

According to my **financial goals** and **risk appetite**,
I target commodities to be 10% of my investment portfolio and crypto to be 15%.
I primarily buy these assets on [Trading212](https://www.trading212.com/invite/FMqHiTlg)
and [Binance](https://guy.coinbureau.com/binance/) (both are special links with perks).
I explained why these were the best options for me in the section
[Broker/Exchange](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#brokerexchange).

| **Commodities** | **10%** |
| **Crypto**      | **15%** |

## Commodities

> A commodity is a **basic good used in commerce** that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type.
— [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)

<!-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity) expands on the above definition with
"the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them." -->
Let's see what commodities are available on Trading212:

[gold standard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp).
US gradually abandoned it between 1930s and early 1970s.
[fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).
"fiat" is derived from the Latin "fieri" meaning an arbitrary act or decree.

- Inflation following the [1973–1975 recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%931975_recession)
- [2000s commodities boom/super cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_commodities_boom)

Why is gold performing so well as a commodity?
Scarcity
(at least on Earth).

With ETFs and other funds,
there are usually costs consumed by the provider managing the fund as their fee to cover their expenses.
This is called the [Total Expense Ratio (TER)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ter.asp).
iShares Global Water ETF (DH2O/IH2O) is an index ETF and so has a low TER at [0.65%](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251913/ishares-global-water-ucits-etf).

[Gore Street Energy Storage Fund plc (GSF)](https://www.gsenergystoragefund.com/content/about/fund)
is a company with a fund that invests in a diversiﬁed portfolio of energy storage projects primarily located in the UK & Ireland.
The vision is that a future relying mostly on renewable energy (which is not consistent) needs large energy storage to fill the gap between demand and generation.
The fund targets a **dividend yield of 7%** and this has been achieved in at least the [last 2 years](https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/g/gore-street-energy-storage-fund-plc-ord/dividends).
For reference, [4%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPHD) is pretty good for dividend-paying companies so 7% is impressive.
However, this comes at a sizeable expense ratio of around [2.74%](https://www.gsenergystoragefund.com/docs/librariesprovider22/archive/gsf_fact-sheet_2021.pdf).

| Asset name                          | Ticker | Target Weight | Target Allocation |
|-------------------------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Commodities**                     |        |               |       **10%**     |
| Bitcoin                             |  BTC   |       3       |        4.3%       |
| iShares Global Water USD ETF        |  DH2O  |       3       |        4.3%       |
| Gore Street Energy Storage Fund plc |  GSF   |       1       |        1.4%       |
{:.right-figures-3}

I've set GSF to the lowest allocation because it was only listed in 2018 and as it's still small ([£400M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GSF.L) market cap), there's quite some risk and uncertainty.
The other 2 assets I've split equally between the remaining allocation for commodities asset class.

I discovered the Carbon ETF recently and it seems interesting but I want to do some more research before adding it.

### Stock to flow

To demonstrate this relationship between scarcity and market value of an asset,
we need to be able to give a number to scarcity.

[Stock-to-Flow model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)

High S2F are less susceptible to swings in supply;
price is inelastic to supply.

FDR took USD (and others) off the gold standard.

### Bitcoin as digital gold

S2F:
_The Bitcoin Standard_ book by S. Ammous

[Review of S2F model for Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/jfjjWAmGks4)

Immutable distributed ledger.
Immutable: really hard to change, basically there forever;
Distributed: no single computer can decide, but a network of computers;
Ledger: table of information.
Powered by cryptography

- decentralised
- resistant to censorship
- trustless
- permissionless

most secure payment method.
History forever there.

## Crypto

### Learning

[Crypto YouTubers Tier List](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mekhv7/crypto_youtubers_tier_list/)

### Background

Ethereum:
Turing-complete virtual network that runs applications and stores information on a blockchain.
Turing-completeness means anything is programmable.

Smart contracts are not really contracts but pieces of code that codify business logic, at the core they:

- store rules
- verify rules
- execute rules

Web 3.0

The blockchain Trilemma [Vitalik Buterin]:

- Security
- Decentralisation
- Scalability

Decentralisation:

- Architectural
- Political
- Logical (not blockchains, i.e. logic is common)

Benefits:

- Fault tolerance
- Attack resistance
- Collusion resistance (political?)

Smart Contracts:

1. Security
2. Guaranteed execution
3. Transparency
4. Trust minimisation
5. Efficiency

Paper guarantee (brand based) vs cryptographic guarantee (math based)

Eth 2.0:

- PoS and reduced tranaction (gas) fees
- sharding for scalability

Issuance of new ETH will reduce from 4.5% to 0.5-0.8% an together with EIP-1559 (burning of most gas fees) will likely result in ETH becoming deflationary.
