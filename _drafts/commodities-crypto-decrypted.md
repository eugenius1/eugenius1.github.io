subtitle: A software engineer's investing thesis. No dogs.

Cryptocurrency (crypto) is an asset class that most people haven't yet truly understood.
They are new and complex but also have a lot of potential to forever transform the world,
much like the internet has done.
To explain crypto, I have to explain Bitcoin,
and to explain Bitcoin, I have to explain commodities.

I have owned cryptocurrencies since 2018 because I saw their potential.
I started mindfully investing in 2020
and started truly understanding them in 2021.

## Part 1 recap

If you haven't already, I highly recommend reading [_Part 1: The Awakening_](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/)
of my investing blog series before reading this article.
Seriously, go scroll through my **7 key points before investing**.

> "I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. **Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.**"  
> — Warren Buffett (one of the greatest investors of all time)

The section on [**Mindset**](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#mindset) is really important
and even more so for crypto which is highly volatile.
Crypto today has a lot of both **greed and fear spread around**,
by both individuals and institutions.
It's important to not follow either of these extreme emotions and instead stay logical.

According to my **financial goals** and **risk appetite**,
I target commodities to be 10% of my investment portfolio and crypto to be 15%.
I primarily buy these assets on [Trading212](https://www.trading212.com/invite/FMqHiTlg)
and [Binance](https://guy.coinbureau.com/binance/) (both are special links with perks).
I explained why these were the best options for me in the section
[Broker/Exchange](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#brokerexchange).

| Asset Class     | Target Allocation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Stocks          |             60%   |
| Bonds           |             15%   |
| **Commodities** |           **10%** |
| **Crypto**      |           **15%** |

## Commodities

> A commodity is a **basic good used in commerce** that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type.  
> — [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)

As an asset class, commodities may provide one or both of these benefits:

- **Inflation hedge**: to grow with inflation in the long run.
The idea here is that the price of basic goods needed for daily life tend to move up with inflation.
- **Decorrelation**: to diversify a portfolio by providing relatively low correlation to other asset classes (e.g. stocks, bonds).

Let's see what commodities are available on Trading212:

TODO: physical vs futures

### Performance comparison

Let's take these commodity types and see how they've performed historically.
Below is how they've performed in percentage terms from 2008 to 2021.
I've include gold, a classic commodity, as well as S&P 500 Index (SPX), a common reference of the stock market.
Prices of goods in the United States inflated by around [28.5%](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) from 2008 to 2021.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Reminder</strong>: Past performance is <strong>not a reliable indicator</strong> of future returns.

{:.small}
{:.text-center}

- SPX &mdash; S&P 500 Index: **stocks**
- DH2O &mdash; iShares Global **Water** USD
- VZLE &mdash; WisdomTree Physical **Precious Metals**
- CARB &mdash; WisdomTree **Carbon**
- AIG**I** &mdash; WisdomTree **Industrial Metals**
- AIG**A** &mdash; WisdomTree **Agriculture**
- [DJP](https://www.ipathetn.com/US/16/en/details.app?instrumentId=1193) &mdash; iPath Bloomberg **Commodity Index** (or CMOD on Trading212)
- AIG**L** &mdash; WisdomTree **Livestock**
- AIG**O** &mdash; WisdomTree **Petroleum**
- AIG**E** &mdash; WisdomTree **Energy** (fossil fuels)
{:.small}

What we see first is that all commodity types have underperformed the stock market at least since 2018 with the exception of DH2O that is roughly on par.
DH2O is made up of **water** companies' stocks so it makes sense for it be performing as well as the stock market and highly correlated.
Some may argue that DH2O should only count as a stock ETF and not a commodity ETF
but I think water is a very important, daily basic good whose value shouldn't be ignored.

Second best performing type was precious metals (VZLE).
Gold is part of this index ETF but because gold underperforms,
it means there is at least one other precious metal that has performed better.
What is also noteworthy is that precious metals (and in particular gold) demonstrated **decorrelation** to the stock market by staying strong during the **crashes** of [2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)
and [early 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash).
Investors have typically switched from stocks to inflation hedges like gold when the economy is uncertain and vice versa.

After gold comes carbon then industrial metals which performed just under US inflation.
The other commodity types (agriculture, livestock, petroleum and fossil fuels) have lost significant value,
with fossil fuels having lost 82% not accounting for inflation in the 13 years!
Ethically, I don't believe in a future for fossil fuels and their performance as assets really cements that in.
DJP, a commodity index, has also lost significant value and checking today's composition shows 72% is in fossil fuels, agriculture and livestock.

Now let's see the 4 precious metals since 1997 (oldest data I could get for palladium & platinum):

![Performance of the 4 precious metals 1997-2021: gold, silver, palladium, platinum](/raw/img/blog/2022/investing/commodities/precious-metals-1997-2021.png)
{:.small}
{:.text-center}

First obvious thing is that palladium has vastly outperformed the other assets including stocks and particularly since 2017.
[Palladium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium) is mostly used in [catalytic converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter) which convert toxic pollutants in exhaust gases from internal combustion engines (e.g. in automobiles) into less toxic pollutants.
From what I've gathered, the price jump is due to [lacking supply](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/palladium-investing/palladium-outlook/) and speculation.
This brings us to a very common law in economics.

[**Law of supply and demand**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp):
This theory says that the **quantity and price** of something in a market (e.g. financial assets, food, electricity)
moves towards an equilibrium where **supply and demand are matched**.
In palladium's case the supply reduced and assuming the demand didn't change much, the price went up.
Inversely, if the supply goes up while the demand doesn't change, the price goes down.
Conversely, the price follows the direction of demand if the supply remains unchanged.
So decreased supply and unchanged demand leads to higher prices which leads to both lower demand and an increase in supply (producing or just selling becomes more profitable) and so on until an equilibrium of supply & demand.

Another thing to note is the presence of **market cycles**.
For example, palladium peaked in 2001 and all others in 2011 during the [2000s commodities boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_commodities_boom).
From this time perspective (24 years), 3 out of the 4 precious metals have outperformed stocks but some of them with a lot of **volatility** along the way.
Gold seems to be the least volatile while delivering the second best performance after palladium.

### Types of money

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The concepts here help to better understand cryptocurrency.
</div>

[**Gold standard**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp):
For several millennia, this shiny metal has been used both as a monetary unit to trade goods & services (along with silver)
and as a store of value & wealth.
We transitioned to paper money that was backed by gold (most commonly) or silver.
However, [the Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp) of the 1930s led to countries starting to drop the gold standard.
Countries that dropped it earlier [recovered quicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Gold_standard).
With the gold standard, inflation can be avoided but strict commitment to it can create economic instability.

<!-- > "We have gold because we **cannot trust governments**."  
> &mdash; President Herbert Hoover in his 1933 statement to Franklin D. Roosevelt (successor) -->

[**Fiat money**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp):
"fiat" is a Latin word often translated as "it shall be".
With the gold standard dropped, paper money today has **no intrinsic value** as no precious metals back it.
Through supply & demand, the value of fiat money comes entirely from the **trust** that we people put on it because a government or its central bank issued it.

A major benefit of fiat money is that it gives central banks great control over the economy as they control money's supply, e.g. recovery from the Great Depression.
Some may argue this is (also) a disadvantage as we humans are flawed and no less when given power.
Supply can be increased usually by ["printing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money#Money_creation_and_regulation) more money and it can be decreased by increasing interest rates so more money is saved and less circulates.

However, fiat money is not a bulletproof way of protecting the economy as it can lead to severe inflation and even [hyperinflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp) (over 50% per month) that usually leads to the country switching from their local fiat currency to a foreign one.
Recent examples include [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) and [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela) (ongoing as of 2021).
This not to say that severe and hyperinflation are only caused by using fiat money as summarised on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp):

> It is unclear whether or not hyperinflations are caused by "runaway printing" of money. In fact, hyperinflations have occurred throughout history, even when money was based on precious metals; and all contemporary hyperinflations have begun with a fundamental breakdown in the real **production economy** and/or **political instability** in the country.

On the other side, low inflation can be seen as a positive for economic growth as it encourages people to put their money to work to avoid losing purchasing power over time.

### Stock-to-flow

In the thousands of years of history, why has gold held value consistently?
The answer is scarcity, at least on Earth.
Today the amount of gold already mined is much more than the yearly production which results in its price not changing much due to changes in yearly production.
This means that the price of gold is mainly affected by changes in human sentiment, which affects market supply and demand.

To demonstrate the relationship between scarcity and market value of an asset,
we need to be able to quantify scarcity.
Economics professor [Dr. Saifedean Ammous](https://books.google.fr/books/about/The_Bitcoin_Standard.html?id=wf9QDwAAQBAJ) talks about scarcity in terms of of **stock-to-flow ratio** (SF) where stock is the size of the existing stockpiles and flow is the yearly production:

> SF = stock / flow

A former institutional investor with the pseudonym PlanB wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) including the table below with the 4 precious metals and their stock-to-flow ratios:

<!-- TODO: convert to text -->
![2019 stock-to-flow data of the 4 precious metals: gold, silver, palladium, platinum](/raw/img/blog/2022/investing/commodities/precious-metals-stock-to-flow.png)
{:.small}
{:.text-center}

As of 2019, gold had the highest stock-to-flow ratio of the precious metals at 62.
In other words, it would takes 62 years of production to double the amount of gold above ground.
For palladium that number was only 1.1 years.
Commodities with higher SF ratios are less affected by changes in production and have lower [price elasticity of supply](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-does-price-elasticity-affect-supply.asp).
This explains gold's low price volatility amongst the precious metals.

These SF ratios may not significantly increase anytime soon as PlanB explains in the same article:

> It is almost impossible for commodities to get a higher SF, because as soon as somebody hoards them, price rises, production rises, and price falls again. It is very hard to escape this trap.

What if there was a scarce commodity like gold that you could easily transport via a medium like the internet?

We'll dive into Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies before I reveal my commodity choices.

## Crypto

### Learning

I started investing in cryptocurrencies in 2018 after some discussions with colleagues but I was aware of them at least a year earlier near the end of university.
From 2018 to 2020, most of my learning was hands-on in the crypto space especially while trying to make an outperforming crypto trading bot (spoiler: it's hard).
In early 2020, I zoomed out to realise the **bigger picture**:

- Crypto has potential too big to ignore
- In the medium-long term, **investing** delivers strong gains with far **less effort & stress** than trading

There are plenty of resources online these days to learn about crypto.
I've made a [**YouTube playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJr1hnSQ56-Zyg48p5zKarzIOJh2vwaCk)
with all the videos that I think are helpful, sorted from fundamental topics to those more advanced.
If you're new to crypto I **highly recommend** watching at least the first video (it's only 2 mins).
Pro tip: I normally watch at 1.5x speed.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJr1hnSQ56-Zyg48p5zKarzIOJh2vwaCk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="center-block"></iframe>

Some of the YouTube channels I follow:

- [<i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i> Coin Bureau](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoinBureau): education, coin reviews, news
- [<i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i> Benjamin Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg): solid market analysis
- [<i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i> uncomplication](https://www.youtube.com/c/uncomplication): a few interesting things like psychology

As there's a lot of greed and fear around crypto, you have to be careful with the information and advice you consume especially on YouTube.
I prefer to have all the info I need to make an investing decision rather than to be blindly sold something.
**Reddit** has this [Crypto YouTubers Tier List](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mekhv7/crypto_youtubers_tier_list/) that you could use to see if a channel you've spotted shares info you should listen to or avoid.
Reddit is an open, online community for discussing almost anything and everything.
Searching the internet for something followed by "reddit" can give you some indication of whether that thing is legit or a scam.

In addition to the videos, these are some of the other top, beginner-friendly learning resources:

- [Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/) &mdash; each article shows a difficulty rating: beginner, intermediate, advanced.

### Generations

#### 1st gen: Bitcoin & wannabes

**Bitcoin & its creator**:
In October 2008,
a white paper titled [_Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) was published by ["Satoshi Nakamoto"](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto).
It's still a mystery who Satoshi Nakamoto really is over a decade later.
They could be a man, a woman or a group of people.
They demonstrated world-class programming skills (in C++) and great understanding of economics, cryptography and peer-to-peer networking.
For the top candidates see [this video](https://youtu.be/cuItlQZ3RQg).

The 9-page white paper gives a comprehensive overview of this creation that builds on top of some existing cryptography ideas & technologies.
A lot of the paper is quite a heavy read for the average person but the first line gives a brief summary:

> A **purely peer-to-peer** version of **electronic cash** would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another **without going through a financial institution**.

This means that Bitcoin was designed to be a system of transferring monetary value (cash).
This system is collectively run by the people (peer-to-peer) and doesn't need any central financial institution such as a bank.
The Bitcoin white paper came during the severe, global [financial crisis of 2007–2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) that was partly caused by excessive risks taken by financial institutions.

With a truly-digital form of cash, how do you stop someone from "copy-pasting" or spending the same $10 at 2 different sellers?
In today's centralised approach with banks, they are responsible for accounting and ordering transactions to avoid [**double-spending**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/double-spending-explained).
Bitcoin was the first to solve the double-spend problem in a decentralised (peer-to-peer) approach using new technology.

**Blockchain**:
This is simply a database, or you could think of it as a notebook.
With Bitcoin, a blockchain/database is used to maintain accounting of all existing bitcoins (the currency unit) and all transactions.
Transactions are not added one-by-one but are collectively added as part of a block (page).
Unlike most databases, a blockchain can only be added to and existing data cannot be changed (**immutability**).
This is because each block of the chain (or page of the notebook) has a cryptographic (mathematical) snapshot&mdash;a **hash**&mdash;of the previous block (page).
To correctly change an old block, you'd have to also update all the blocks between it and the latest one.

Here's a visual and more detailed explanation:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSo_EIwHSd4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="center-block"></iframe>

**Nodes & miners**:
How are new blocks added?
The Bitcoin peer-to-peer payment network is collectively run by what are called **nodes** which are computers that run software that implement the Bitcoin protocol (set of rules).
A copy of the blockchain is stored by each node of the network.
Some of these nodes are also **miners** as they compete against other miners to be the first to mine (add) a new block to the chain of blocks.

[**Mining**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-cryptocurrency-mining) a new block requires solving a mathematical puzzle.
New pending transactions to be added to the blockchain have to go into a new block together with a **mathematical signature/fingerprint ([hash](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-hashing))**.
A typical Bitcoin block holds roughly [2,000 transactions](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions-per-block).
The difficulty of creating the mathematical signature is dynamically adjusted by the Bitcoin protocol about every 2 weeks such that it should take an average of **10 minutes** to mine a new block.

Mining makes Bitcoin use **a lot of electricity** but also makes it **increasingly more secure**.
Mining forms part of [**Proof-of-work (PoW)**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/proof-of-work-explained) consensus algorithm,
a way for the independent nodes to agree on what the **truth** is.
Each valid block in the chain has an energy cost behind it due to the difficulty of the mathematical signature of each block.
The longer a chain is, the higher the total energy cost and the more likely it is to be accepted as the truth by nodes.
So if someone wanted to change an old block, they'd have to do **both** of these:

- use a lot of electricity to mine new blocks since and including the old block
- [51% (majority) attack](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/51-percent-attack): convince other nodes to accept their modified chain as the truth by adding new pending transactions faster than other miners.

**Halving**:
Miners are incentivised to mine as they get both a **reward for mining** a new block to the chain and **transaction fees** from the transactions added in the block.
This reward started at 50 BTC per block and is halved about every 4 years.
Bitcoin has a **maximum supply** of 210 million BTC so when all BTC will have been mined (around the year 2078) then there will be no more block rewards. <!-- TODO: link year -->
Miners will only receive transaction fees with each new block.
It is thought that transaction fees can be enough mining incentive assuming the price of one bitcoin will be significantly higher than today's.<!-- TODO: link or "I think" -->

So what is Bitcoin?

- a currency?
- a network of computers?
- a blockchain (public, immutable database)?
- a global payment system?
- a protocol (set of rules)?

All of the above. "Bitcoin" can refer to any of the above related concepts.

Bitcoin as a **payment system** is the **most secure** in the world. <!-- TODO: link & why -->
The benefits that Bitcoin payment system brings:

- **Decentralised** &mdash; no single point of failure.
- **Immutable** &mdash; history on the blockchain is incredibly hard to be changed and it remains there forever, existing as a copy in each node.
- **Resistant to censorship** &mdash; control of Bitcoin is not with any single entity but with everyone collectively so no government or hacker can actually stop Bitcoin.
- **Trustless** &mdash; no central authority to trust, e.g. bank; trust is put on cryptography & computer software.
- **Permissionless** &mdash; no one can stop you from transacting unlike with banks.

##### Bitcoin as digital gold

PlanB presented the [Stock-to-Flow model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25).

Ammous estimated that Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio will overtake that of gold around 2022.

[Review of S2F model for Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/jfjjWAmGks4)

##### Energy use & greenhouse gas emissions

Figuring out the total energy use and emissions of Bitcoin is **really complex**.
This is largely because it's a decentralised network so it could be anyone anywhere, and collecting & aggregating all this data is hard.

You may have seen headlines such as "[Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina'](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)"
but they are not helpful as they don't put things into context.
For example, Bitcoin still uses **less** electricity and has [less emissions](https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-2022) than all the clothes dryers in the world.

**What should we compare Bitcoin to?**
In a way, it's trying to replace parts of the current banking system (notably the [settlement layer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement-bank.asp) and cross-border payments) and it can also be seen as a replacement for gold as a store of value.
For context, [40%](http://oilprice.com/Metals/Gold/Gold-Mining-Boom-Increasing-Mercury-Pollution-Risk.html) of newly produced gold is used directly as an investment asset and 50% for jewelry.
In May 2021, [Galaxy Digital](https://docsend.com/view/adwmdeeyfvqwecj2) estimated the annual energy consumption of bitcoin at 114 terawatt-hours per year, the majority of the banking system at 264 and gold at 241, as illustrated below:

![Estimated Annual Energy Consumption (TWh/yr) of the banking system, gold & bitcoin](/raw/img/blog/2022/investing/crypto/energy-consumption-banking-gold-bitcoin.png)
[&copy; Galaxy Digital](https://docsend.com/view/adwmdeeyfvqwecj2)
{:.small}
{:.text-center}

To put the above figures into more context, Bitcoin's estimated energy consumption is **0.4%** of the global amount of generated electricity,
and **0.07%** of the global energy supply.

Bitcoin uses a lot of energy **by design** and not by flaw due to its Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm that involves mining.
On the other hand, more modern cryptocurrencies today use very little energy due to alternative, newer consensus algorithms.
However, the security of these consensus algorithms has not yet been proven to match that of PoW and so this topic is still considered ongoing research.
University of Cambridge [notes](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/faq):

> Other consensus mechanisms may appear less ‘wasteful’ at first sight but have their own downsides that may not always be immediately apparent.

But high energy use doesn't mean that Bitcoin needs large greenhouse gas emissions to function.
The greener that electricity generation becomes by turning away from fossil fuels,
the greener that Bitcoin mining becomes.
According to a [report by CoinShares](https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-2022) ([summary video](https://youtu.be/UCwLIE62iWg)),
as of December 2021, around 61% of the electricity used to mine Bitcoin comes from **fossil fuels** like coal (35%) & gas (24%).
These figures are more an illustration of the electricity sources for where Bitcoin is being mined.
The top 2 mining countries are currently the United States and Kazakhstan.

![Bitcoin Mining: Energy Source Types: 61% fossil fuel, 28% renewable & 11% nuclear](/raw/img/blog/2022/investing/crypto/bitcoin-mining-energy-source-types.png){:style="width: min(100vw, 500px)"}

In the meantime, CoinShares estimates the cost of **offsetting** Bitcoin's emissions by buying carbon credits to be **200 USD per bitcoin per year** if shared among all bitcoin holders.
That's around **0.6% per year** at time of writing.

[Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index)
provides an ongoing daily estimate of Bitcoin's power usage with hypothetical minimum and maximum.
The upper bound is significantly higher because when bitcoin's price goes higher it brings in miners with less efficient machines who would now become profitable.

I recommend browsing through [CBECI's FAQ page](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/faq) which answers questions like "Does Bitcoin mining incentivise the deployment of renewable power generation?"

#### 2nd gen: Smart contracts

Economics and relatively slow transaction speed & throughput

Ethereum:
Turing-complete virtual network that runs applications and stores information on a blockchain.
Turing-completeness means anything is programmable.

Smart contracts are not really contracts but pieces of code that codify business logic, at the core they:

- store rules
- verify rules
- execute rules

- Web 1.0: read; static content
- Web 2.0: read-write; interactive content
- Web 3.0: read-write-own; virtual economies

Crypto is not just an alternative money (as introduced by Bitcoin) but an alternative system.

The blockchain Trilemma [Vitalik Buterin]:

- Security
- Decentralisation
- Scalability

Decentralisation:

- Architectural
- Political
- Logical (not blockchains, i.e. logic is common)

Benefits:

- Fault tolerance
- Attack resistance
- Collusion resistance (political?)

Smart Contracts:

1. Security
2. Guaranteed execution
3. Transparency
4. Trust minimisation
5. Efficiency

Paper guarantee (brand based) vs cryptographic guarantee (math based)

#### 3rd gen: Scalability

Eth 2.0:

- PoS and reduced tranaction (gas) fees
- sharding for scalability

Issuance of new ETH will reduce from 4.5% to 0.5-0.8% an together with EIP-1559 (burning of most gas fees) will likely result in ETH becoming deflationary.

<hr>

##### My crypto choices

<hr>

##### Blockchains

General-purpose blockchains:

- Ethereum
- Cardano (ADA): Ethereum co-founder; peer-reviewed
- Polkadot (DOT) & Kusama (KSM): Ethereum co-founder; parachains
- Binance Chain & Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
- Cosmos (ATOM): very good project but subpar tokenomics due to subpar need for ATOM
- Solana: very fast layer-1 (50k-700k TPS capability!) but tokenomics let down by steep vesting schedule (Dec 2020)  But less transparency, e.g. vesting schedule shows circulating supply in Jan 2021 should be 95% but is 55% as of Apr 2021.
- Avalanche (AVAX): 2 consensus engines: parallelisable DAG (Avalanche) & totally-ordered chain (Snowman)
- Elrond (EGLD): Adaptive State Sharding with sharded state, transactions, and network
- Algorand (ALGO): Permissionless Pure Proof-Of-Stake; strong candidate for CBDC; lacking tokenomics
- Terra (LUNA): algorithmic stablecoin platform, synthetic asset protocol (Mirror) and stablecoin lending platform (Anchor) with 18-20% APY!
- Harmony (ONE): random state sharding
- Fantom (FTM): DAG
<!-- - Stacks (STX): enabling secure applications and smart contracts on Bitcoin -->
<!-- - NEAR Protocol: ? -->

<!-- TODO: refactor this to privacy, IoT & other  -->
Purpose-built blockchains:

- Stellar (XLM): payments
- VeChain (VET): supply-chain
- Monero (XMR): basically bitcoin with privacy
- Secret (SCRT): smart contract privacy
- Haven (XHV): Fork of Monero to allow pegged assets like stablecoins
- Helium (HNT): low-power IoT; 5G

<hr>

##### Data

- Chainlink [Ethereum]: data oracle
- Filecoin (FIL): data storage for IFPS (InterPlanetary File System)
- Arweave (AR): decentralised data storage; used by Solana to archive its large history (due to high TPS)
- Ocean protocol [Ethereum]: big data
- The Graph (GRT) [Ethereum]: data indexing

<hr>

##### Decentralised Finance (DeFi)

Decentralised Exchanges (DeX):

- Uniswap [Ethereum]: scalability limitations before Ethereum 2.0
- THORChain (RUNE) [Binance Chain, Ethereum]: cross-chain DeX
- 1inch: DeX Aggregator
- Loopring (LRC) [Ethereum]: open protocol for scalable, orderbook-based DeX’s

[DeX you can trade stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YHe9-mN2Hs):

- Serum (SRM) [Solana]:
Not going for Synthetix (SNX) and UMA because they are built on Ethereum so limited by Ethereum’s lacking scalability.
- Injective (INJ) [Cosmos] are good.

Borrowing & lending:

- Aave [Ethereum]: liquidity
- Compound [Ethereum]: liquidity

Other DeFi:

- Ren [Ethereum]: trustless, permissionless Inter-Blockchain Liquidity
- Kyber Network (KNC) [Ethereum]: on-chain liquidity protocol that aggregates reserves to allow token swaps. For example, a merchant receiving BTC payments and having them automatically converted to a stable coin like DAI.

<hr>

##### Centralised Finance

Centralised Exchanges:

- Binance Coin (BNB): as well as being the native coin of 2 Binance blockchains, it is also closely related to the exchange.
- FTX Token (FTT) [Ethereum]: derivatives pioneer
- KuCoin Token (KCS) [Ethereum]: altcoins
<!-- - WazirX (WRX) [Binance]: India -->

Borrowing & lending:

- Celsius [Ethereum]: better lending due to rehypothecation (securities lending) to institutions
- Nexo [Ethereum]:

<hr>

##### Ethereum Scaling Solutions

- Polygon (MATIC): built from Vitalik Buterin’s plasma paper
- Optimisim: no token
- OMG

<hr>

##### NFT ecosystems

- Theta (& TFUEL) [Ethereum]: video streaming
- Enjin [Ethereum]: gaming & NFTs
- Chiliz (CHZ): fan tokens of sport teams
- Flow (FLOW) [Binance Chain, Ethereum]: sport fan tokens & more (games & apps)
- Immutable X (IMX) [Ethereum]: Ethereum scaling solution focused on NFTS. Not in my portfolio at time of writing at least.

### Managing the portfolio

#### 3commas

## My commodity choices

As mentioned earlier, **water** is perhaps the most common basic good and whose value shouldn't be ignored in my opinion.
ETFs and other funds usually have costs consumed by the provider managing the fund to cover their expenses.
This is called the [Total Expense Ratio (TER)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ter.asp).
iShares Global Water ETF (DH2O/IH2O) is an index ETF and so has a low TER at [0.65%](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251913/ishares-global-water-ucits-etf).

TODO: gold and bitcoin

[Gore Street **Energy Storage** Fund plc (GSF)](https://www.gsenergystoragefund.com/content/about/fund)
is a company with a fund that invests in a diversiﬁed portfolio of energy storage projects primarily located in the UK & Ireland.
The vision is that a future relying mostly on renewable energy (which is not consistent) needs large energy storage to fill the gap between demand and generation.
The fund targets a **dividend yield of 7%** and this has been achieved in at least the [last 2 years](https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/g/gore-street-energy-storage-fund-plc-ord/dividends).
For reference, [4%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPHD) is pretty good for dividend-paying companies so 7% is impressive.
However, this comes at a major expense ratio of around [2.74%](https://www.gsenergystoragefund.com/docs/librariesprovider22/archive/gsf_fact-sheet_2021.pdf).
In my mind, I subtract this from their target dividend yield which equates to just over 4%.

| Asset name                          | Ticker          | Target Weight | Target Allocation |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Commodities**                     |                 |               |           **10%** |
| ~~Gold~~<br>Bitcoin                 | ~~IS0E~~<br>BTC |             3 |            4.3%   |
| iShares Global Water USD ETF        | DH2O            |             3 |            4.3%   |
| Gore Street Energy Storage Fund plc | GSF             |             1 |            1.4%   |
{:.right-figures-3}

I've set GSF to the lowest allocation as it was only listed in 2018 and it's still relatively small
([£400M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GSF.L) market cap) so there's quite some risk and uncertainty in its future.
The other 2 assets I've split equally between the remaining allocation for commodities asset class.

I discovered the Carbon ETF recently and it seems interesting but I want to do some more research before adding it.
