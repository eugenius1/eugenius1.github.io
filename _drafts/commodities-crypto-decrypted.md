subtitle: A software engineer's investing thesis. No DOGE.

Cryptocurrency (crypto) is an asset class that most people haven't yet truly understood.
They are new and complex but also have a lot of potential to forever transform the world,
much like the internet has done.
To explain crypto, I have to explain Bitcoin,
and to explain Bitcoin, I have to explain commodities.

I have owned cryptocurrencies since 2018 because I saw their potential.
I started mindfully investing in 2020
and started truly understanding them in 2021.

## Part 1 recap

If you haven't already, I highly recommend reading [_Part 1: The Awakening_](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/)
of my investing blog series before reading this article.
Seriously, go scroll through my **7 key points before investing**.

> "I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. **Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.**" — Warren Buffett (one of the greatest investors of all time)

The section on [**Mindset**](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#mindset) is really important
and even more so for crypto which is highly volatile.
Crypto today has a lot of both **greed and fear spread around**,
by both individuals and institutions.
It's important to not follow either of these extreme emotions and instead stay logical.

Commodities take up **10%** of my target investment portfolio and crypto takes up **15%**.
I primarily buy these assets on [Trading212](https://www.trading212.com/invite/FMqHiTlg)
and [Binance](https://guy.coinbureau.com/binance/) (both are special links with perks).
I explained why these were the best options for me in the section
[Broker/Exchange](/blog/my-investing-journey-1-the-awakening/#brokerexchange).

| Asset Class     |         |
|-----------------|---------|
| Stocks          |   60%   |
| Bonds           |   15%   |
| **Commodities** | **10%** |
| **Crypto**      | **15%** |

## Commodities

> A commodity is a **basic good used in commerce** that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type.
— [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp)

<!-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity) expands on the above definition with
"the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them." -->
Let's see what commodities are available on Trading212:

[gold standard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp).
US gradually abandoned it between 1930s and early 1970s.

"fiat" is derived from the Latin "fieri" meaning an arbitrary act or decree.

Why is gold performing so well as a commodity?
Scarcity
(at least on Earth).

Palladium:
[supply deficit](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/palladium-investing/palladium-outlook/)

### Stock to flow

To demonstrate this relationship between scarcity and market value of an asset,
we need to be able to give a number to scarcity.

[Stock-to-Flow model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)

High S2F are less susceptible to swings in supply;
price is inelastic to supply.

FDR took USD (and others) off the gold standard.

### Bitcoin as digital gold

S2F:
_The Bitcoin Standard_ book by S. Ammous

[Review of S2F model for Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/jfjjWAmGks4)

Immutable distributed ledger.
Immutable: really hard to change, basically there forever;
Distributed: no single computer can decide, but a network of computers;
Ledger: table of information.
Powered by cryptography

- decentralised
- resistant to censorship
- trustless
- permissionless

most secure payment method.
History forever there.

Economics and relatively slow transaction speed & throughput

## Crypto

### Learning

[Crypto YouTubers Tier List](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mekhv7/crypto_youtubers_tier_list/)

### Background

Ethereum:
Turing-complete virtual network that runs applications and stores information on a blockchain.
Turing-completeness means anything is programmable.

Smart contracts are not really contracts but pieces of code that codify business logic, at the core they:

- store rules
- verify rules
- execute rules


Web 3.0

The blockchain Trilemma [Vitalik Buterin]:

- Security
- Decentralisation
- Scalability

Decentralisation:

- Architectural
- Political
- Logical (not blockchains, i.e. logic is common)

Benefits:

- Fault tolerance
- Attack resistance
- Collusion resistance (political?)

Smart Contracts:

1. Security
2. Guaranteed execution
3. Transparency
4. Trust minimisation
5. Efficiency

Paper guarantee (brand based) vs cryptographic guarantee (math based)

Eth 2.0:

- PoS and reduced tranaction (gas) fees
- sharding for scalability

Issuance of new ETH will reduce from 4.5% to 0.5-0.8% an together with EIP-1559 (burning of most gas fees) will likely result in ETH becoming deflationary.

Reduced volatility of BTC and ETH over time as more utility from people and institutions using the respective blockchains.

- Axie Infinity (AXS) hosted on Ethereum via their own layer-2 sidechain for scalability.
