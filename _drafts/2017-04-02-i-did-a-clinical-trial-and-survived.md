**<abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>**: I had a great experience and got money that covered my lacking student finance but be aware that clinical trials are not for everyone and rightfully so.

Last month, I successfully completed 8 weeks after being injected with a single dose of a study drug. This is the first brief I received before getting screened:

> The study drug being developed in this study is a compound called benralizumab for the **treatment of asthma**. This is a first time into man study. This study consists of **1 night in–house and 9 outpatients visits**. We are looking for **healthy male** volunteers (aged 18-55). Volunteers must be non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to screening. The inconvenience allowance for this study is **£1,700**.

But before we get started, let me take you back to the beginning.

# Study details

AstraZeneca of Sweden
19-page document
180 participants
Another study centre in Germany

The efficacy and safety of benralizumab has been shown in two large clinical trials in patients that suffer from asthma.

benralizumab reduces asthma exacerbations up to 51% in two late-state studies
more than a thousand patients

> **Simplified Study Title:** A Study in Healthy Volunteers to Compare the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion of Benralizumab when Administered using 2 Different Devices

> **Full Study Title:** A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Parallel Group Phase 1 Pharmocokenetic Comparability Study of Benralizumab Administered using Accessorized Pre-Filled Syringe (APFS) or Autoinjector (AI) in Healthy volunteers

The main purpose of the study is to compare how much of the drug is taken up, how the drug is broken down and removed from the body when administered through the 2 different devices mention above. Another purpose is to see how safe it is, how well it is tolerated and if it causes an immune response (ant-drug antibodies).
