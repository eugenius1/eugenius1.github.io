It's March 2020 and the stock market is taking a nose dive (pictured above on the right) due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
My digital bank [Revolut](https://revolut.com/referral/eusebi8t3!ASO) adds the ability to buy stocks.
That's when I got into stocks and investing.
But the best of all of this has been understanding personal finance and taking it more seriously.

**Personal finance** and managing your money is a really important part of life that, at least from my experience,
isn't really taught in schools and is rarely discussed in close circles.
So if this info isn't passed down from your parents, you fall behind on financial literacy.
Furthermore, financial wellness is more determined by how you manage your money than your income.

Saving & investing are pillars of good personal finance.
**Investing** is making money work for you in the **medium- to long-term**.
It is **not** a get-rich-quick scheme.

In this blog series, I share **my opinions** and my understanding.
