It's March 2020 and the stock market is taking a nose dive (pictured above on the right) due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
My digital bank [Revolut](https://revolut.com/referral/eusebi8t3!ASO) adds the ability to buy stocks.
That's when I got into stocks and the investing mindset.
But the best of all of this has been understanding personal finance and taking it more seriously.

**Personal finance** and managing your money is a really important part of life that, at least from my experience,
isn't really taught in schools and is rarely discussed in close circles.
So if this info isn't passed down from your parents, you fall behind on financial literacy.
Furthermore, financial wellness is more determined by **how you manage** your money than simply your income.

Saving & investing are pillars of good personal finance.
**Investing** is making money work for you in the **medium- to long-term**.
It is **not** a get-rich-quick scheme.
When we don't talk widely about good investing, it leaves a void for scammers to lure the average person with false investments.
If someone offers you "guaranteed" profits without presenting any risks nor financial protection then you should be extremely careful before deciding to enter.

In this series, I share my investing journey, starting with **7 key points** before actually investing.
The first 2 key points I think everyone should be considering even if not planning to invest.

## Learning

> "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest." — Benjamin Franklin

Most of my learning on investing and personal finance has been from YouTube and supplemented by my own internet searches.
I've made a [**YouTube playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJr1hnSQ56-a-lTrZNwUIWr24fJiU6EJo)
with all the videos that I've found helpful, sorted from basics to more advanced topics.
If you're new to investing I **highly recommend** watching at least the first 3 videos.
Pro tip: I normally watch at 1.5x speed.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJr1hnSQ56-a-lTrZNwUIWr24fJiU6EJo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="center-block"></iframe>

I've also made this [succinct summary](/projects/investing/playlists/investing) of the playlist that you can use to jump to topics that may interest you.
I follow the channels/accounts below (and you may see them a lot in my playlist because their content is gold).
What you should keep in mind is they're all in the US so some things like tax may be different for you where you live.

### Short recap

**Asset**:
Something that can be bought with the hope of future profit and/or income. Common examples include stocks, bonds, real estate, currencies and commodities like gold.

**Liability**:
Something that makes you lose money, such as debt or a car (especially a brand new Lamborghini)

**Trading vs investing**:
Generally, trading is short-term buying and selling for profit while investing means holding assets over a longer time (think years).
Trading takes a lot of time and skill, similar to a job, and you're up against (institutional) traders with a lot of money, skill, experience and algorithms.

**Inflation**:
Things costing more money over time due to the decline of a currency's purchasing power.
For example, $100 today can buy less things than $100 10 years ago.

**Stock**:
An asset representing ownership of a fraction of a company.
Units of stock are _shares_.
As a shareholder, you can even vote on some company decisions (depending on your broker)!

**Dividend**:
Some companies use a part of their profits to reward their shareholders every few months or every year.

**Index fund**:
This allows investing in a single, pooled basket of different assets that track an index, e.g. the top 500 US companies (_S&P 500_) or a specific industry like real estate, instead of having to buy individual company stocks.

**Mutual fund**:
Like an index fund but the basket of assets is actively managed (selected) by a team of people instead of the selection being made objectively by an index.
These funds tend to have higher fees than index funds.

**ETF** (Exchange-Traded Fund):
A single basket of assets that can be bought and sold just like a stock and it's price moves up and down many times in a trading day.

**Bond**:
Owning a bond means being the lender to a borrower, typically governments or companies wanting to finance projects or operations.
Usually, the borrower pays interest (annually or more frequent) to the lender/bond owner.

**Commodity**:
A natural/scarce resource like gold or oil, agricultural product like wheat, or even livestock animals.

[**Cryptocurrency**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cryptocurrency):
a digital currency secured by cryptography and typically without a central authority like a bank.
Most are on decentralised networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.

### Mindset

> "I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. **Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.**" — Warren Buffett (one of the greatest investors of all time)

**Markets are emotional**:
Asset prices are fundamentally driven by human emotion and the dynamics of supply and demand.
Many people buy assets with **greed/FOMO** (Fear Of Missing Out) when prices are shooting up,
and panic sell with **fear** when prices are going down.
Places like the stock market are the only places where people run away when prices come down (a good investor sees a **sale**),
and people want to buy more when prices go up.

{:.small}
{:.text-center}

**News**:
It's a good idea to avoid daily financial news and trends while investing,
in fact a lot of it can be considered noise to a long-term investor.
The media is in the business of publishing news that sells, i.e. news that stir emotions.
Some even suggest **going against the news**, for example, if the news says that the markets are crashing and hope is lost,
then that is a great time to be buying, think a Black Friday sale.

A major key to remember is that investing (medium- to long-term) means going through **multiple market cycles** and their ups and downs.
**Never panic sell**, which I did at the very beginning when I was clueless during the 2020 stock market crash.

**Time is the greatest asset**:
Jack & Jill both invest $200 per month but Jack for 10 years (ages 25-35) while Jill for 30 years (ages 35-65).
While Jill has put in 3 times as much money as Jack, at age 65 Jack has a larger portfolio value than Jill because he started 10 years earlier.
**Starting investing earlier** has a greater impact than contributions in later years.

"**Compound interest** is the 8<sup>th</sup> wonder of the world," reportedly said by Albert Einstein.
Time allows investments to compound, much like continually rolling a small **snowball** on snow to grow it into a snowman's body.
The bigger the snowball gets, the more snow it gathers when rolling.
Withdrawing profits or dividends early reduces compounding effects.
The truth is that too many people are impatient and look for get-rich-quick schemes.

Investing always has **risk** and **nothing is guaranteed**.
You could even get back less than what you invested.
In general (as many decades of history has shown), a well-diversified investment portfolio doesn't lose money in the long run.

**Money is just fuel**:
It amplifies who you are and your character.

## 1st: Eliminating bad debt

> Stop the bleeding.

Debt is an inevitable part of life, be it for education or a home, but some are far worse than others to have.
They can also affect your [credit score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score) in different ways.
One key determinant on how bad a loan is, is the **interest rate**.
There isn't a definitive, fixed threshold percentage but it can be compared to:

- **local currency's inflation**: just to give an idea, as of writing this, the UK (a developed country) has a rate of less than 2% while Tanzania (a developing country) has ~7%.

- **investing returns**: US stocks benchmark  _S&P 500_ has a long-term average of 7-10% (USD).
The idea here is if a loan's interest rate is lower than this, then it usually makes more financial sense to invest instead of trying to pay the loan sooner than planned.

The usual bad debt suspects are **credit card debt** and [**payday loans**](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/loans/payday-loans/).
The former is a pretty big problem in the US;
the latter is the worst kind of debt mentioned here.
Typical credit card interests are above 20% especially when you consider compounding interest (APY) instead of the advertised APR without compounding.
See [APR vs APY](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/apr-apy-bank-hopes-cant-tell-difference/) for more info.

I don't use a credit card but the right way to use one would be to fully repay the debt at the end of the month instead of paying the minimum payment needed and carrying the debt (plus interest) over to the next month.

**UK student loan**: I did my undergraduate studies in London and financed them with a loan from the UK government.
The interest rate is variable; I have seen it go as high as 5% but now it's at 2.6%.
UK student loan is quite unique (I've had trouble explaining it to French banks) in that it will be [written off 30 years after my first repayment](https://www.manage-student-loan-balance.service.gov.uk/ors/account-overview/secured/understand-balance-undergraduatePlan2),
even if there is a remaining balance.
This is great especially seeing that my repayments are less than the added interest so the balance keeps increasing!

## 2nd: Emergency fund

> The cushion **when** you fall.

At the same time as making a plan to eliminate bad debt (if any), a plan should also be made for building the emergency fund.
It's savings in a bank account for emergencies, not holidays nor investing.
Why we need it:

1. **Liquidity**: money quickly ready for an emergency expenditure; cash is more liquid than investments.
2. To avoid needing to sell investments at a loss during market declines or crashes in order to cover an emergency.
3. To **let investments compound** over time without disruption.

The general rule for the amount of this fund is to be able to last you **3-6 months** when you have no income.
Less than 3 months is not enough cushion and significantly more than 6 months exposes you significantly to inflation losses.

The vast majority of saving bank accounts don't consistently offer interest rates higher than inflation so **saving is losing**.
This goes against the belief that most of us are led to believe from a young age: "save everything in a bank account".
There's a limit to how much to keep in a cash bank account long-term.

## 3rd: Financial goals

> "It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for." — Robert Kiyosaki (author of _Rich Dad Poor Dad_)

After figuring out how much I need for my emergency fund and setting a plan,
the next step was to ask myself what my financial goals are.
The common themes when asking yourself this question include wealth **accumulation/growth**, wealth **preservation**, **passive income** and **time horizon**.
**Risk tolerance** is also another question to ask yourself.

I don't think one can aim for growth and have a low risk tolerance.
Growth implies higher volatility which means investments can go up strongly as well as down strongly (at least in the short-term).
Time horizon and risk tolerance are usually linked; a shorter time horizon means less risk can be taken.

This link is largely because of **market cycles**.
In the stock market, they have historically lasted 5-7 years on average.
For cryptocurrencies, it currently appears to be 4 years (due to [Bitcoin halving](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769)).
Investing for shorter periods than these while the market is going up has the risk that one day the market will enter the decline phase of the cycle.

For me right now in my mid-20s, my goal is growth.
I will use my investments as a means to an **early retirement**/financial freedom,
while along the way using portions of it for **big projects** like buying **real estate**.
I can tolerate relatively a lot of risk.
As I progress through the decades (and have a family), my goal will transition to less growth and instead towards more passive income and less risk.

Now I need to commit to always align my investments to my financial goals.

## 4th: Active or passive?

> "Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!" — John Bogle (inventor of index fund investing)

With financial goals set, the next step determines time and effort commitment and the range of possible return on investment:

- **Passive** investing is performing **as well as** the market by investing in index funds or index ETFs.
- **Active** investing is trying to **beat** the market.
This requires doing **more research** to choose individual assets like company stocks instead of investing in funds.
It would also need me to stay informed and check on my companies/assets from time to time, let's say at least a few times per year.
There is also **higher risk**, for example a company going bankrupt and my shares becoming worthless.

I could also have chosen to go for a **mix** of both, for example majority passive with a few company stocks I believe in.
Active investing requires one to be confident in their **mathematical and analytical skills**, or at least work to improve them.
It is also a greater test of emotion and **discipline**.

Most (82% of) mutual funds actively managed by a team of professionals don't beat the market, i.e. index funds.
The same holds for active, retail investors trying to do the same thing.
The problem as explained in this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnjennings/2020/09/23/beating-the-market-is-simple-but-not-easy/?sh=603a0da77b6a)
is not **sticking to the plan when underperforming**.
Of the 18% of fund managers that beat the market in a 15-year period,
97% underperformed the market for at least 5 of those years.
I think for many active, retail investors there's also the emotional pitfall of buying high and selling low instead of holding long-term.

Having said that, the pandemic and its lockdowns gave me a lot of **time to learn** and practice active investing.
I am confident in my general analytical skills.
Having a long time horizon and relatively high risk appetite gives me **room for error** and time to correct my strategy.

## 5th: Taxable or non-taxable account?

> "I'm spending a year dead for tax reasons." — Douglas Adams

It is said that our **biggest monetary expense in life** is tax!
Unless one lives in a perfect tax haven, making profit or income from investments usually leads to paying taxes for it.
So arguably the biggest determiner to one's take-home return on investment is how much one pays in tax on their returns.
Also, usually profits and all dividend are usually taxed even if not withdrawn so this can hinder reinvesting dividend (for the compounding effect).

Many countries provide investment accounts with lower or no tax under conditions such as lock-in period, maximum yearly input or limited asset choices.
I will give a brief summary of what I understand but always do your own research and/or seek a tax advisor in your jurisdiction.

In the **UK**, a stocks & shares Individual Savings Account (**ISA**) can be used by UK taxpayers
and the maximum one can put into it is currently [£20,000 for the tax year 2021-22](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts).
Otherwise, profits are subject to [capital gains tax](https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-shares) if above the tax-free allowance,
currently [£12,300](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax/allowances) for the tax year 2021-22.
For dividend, there's also an allowance, currently [£2,000](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends) for the tax year 2021-22.

In **France**, there is the _Plan d'Épargne en Actions_ ([**PEA**](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/particuliers/plan-epargne-actions-pea))
that typically has a 5-year lock-in period,
has lower or no tax but still subject to social security contributions ([17.2%](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F22449)) at withdrawal.
If withdrawing early, tax is exempt under certain conditions such as starting a business or retirement,
otherwise gains are taxed at [12.8%](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F22449).
One big drawback with these accounts in France is they limit to investing in companies registered in the European Economic Area (EEA)
and funds that can provide [less than 25%](https://www.amf-france.org/en/node/59240) exposure outside this area;
so no individual, international stocks.
Also, fees everywhere such as [0.5%](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/particuliers/plan-epargne-actions-pea) transaction fee if online, otherwise 1.2%.

So currently only being a **French taxpayer** aiming for active growth,
and seeing that there is still 17.2% social security contributions to pay when withdrawing from a French taxable account,
I have **not** chosen the PEA and instead willing to be taxed higher for the sake of more international investment choices.

## 6th: Asset classes

> "The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator." — Ben Graham (the father of value investing)

After tax, the next biggest determiner to returns is asset class allocation, even more than the choice of which individual assets.

### Basics

An asset class groups investments that show similar characteristics, for example stocks and bonds behave quite differently.
Each asset class has its own profile of risk, volatility and possible range of returns.
**Diversifying** is really important because it avoids putting all your eggs in one basket of common risk.

In addition to diversification, **correlation** is also an important aspect to consider.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two things move in relation to each other
(but not saying which causes which to move).
Having asset classes with low (or negative) correlation to each other can mean that when one goes down,
the others **tend** to be unaffected (or even move up if negatively correlated).

I think the 4 major, noteworthy asset classes are:

- **Stocks** a.k.a. **equities**:
volatile in the short term, follow the economy in the long run.
Wide range of stocks for different financial goals.

- **Bonds** a.k.a. **fixed income**:
more stable than stocks, least volatile, lowest (but not zero) risk.
Price is affected by inflation and central bank interest rates.

- **Commodities**:
run parallel to inflation in the long run.
Relatively low correlation to other asset classes.

- **Cryptocurrencies** a.k.a. crypto:
young, rapidly evolving, highest volatility, highest risk, highly speculative right now.
Low (possibly lowest) correlation to other asset classes.

Other major asset classes include cash (that we all know), foreign currencies and valuable inventory like artwork and collectibles.
There is also one more which for this scope I'm classifying as part of stocks:

- **Real estate**:
price and rental income run parallel to inflation in the long run.

**Geographies**:
Another aspect to diversify instead of putting all your eggs in one country or region of the world.
A common way to divide this is:

- Domestic
- International developed countries
- Emerging countries

### Allocations

With some understanding of the characteristics of the different asset classes,
the next step is to assign a percentage to each of them based on one's financial goals.

The common **rule of thumb** (not strict rule) is for the percentage in bonds to equal one's age.
You can also have a look at the [target retirement funds](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/what-are-target-retirement-funds)
from Vanguard (pioneer of index funds),
either for inspiration or as a **super-easy passive** way to invest if you're in a country like the UK or the US but not France.
These funds only provide exposure to stocks and bonds but not commodities nor crypto.

![Asset mix of Vanguard's target retirement funds against one's age. Bonds going from 20% to 70%, with the rest being stocks.](/raw/img/blog/2021/investing/vanguard-target-retirement-funds-asset-mix.png)

Personally, I found the [8 Lazy Portfolios](https://obliviousinvestor.com/8-lazy-etf-portfolios/)
to be good inspiration in deciding allocations.
If you're in the UK, there's a [UK-oriented view](https://monevator.com/9-lazy-portfolios-for-uk-passive-investors-2010/) that might also be worth reading.
I started with David Swensen's Ivy League Portfolio and chose to have the asset classes and allocation percentages below.
As a seeker of **growth** and acknowledging the US as the centre of the world's economy (at least for the foreseeable future),
I've set the majority (roughly ⅔) of my stocks to be American companies.

| Asset Class                                |       2020         |       2021         |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Stocks                                     |        60%         |        60%         |
| <small>- US</small>                        | <small>30%</small> | <small>27%</small> |
| <small>- Other developed countries</small> | <small>15%</small> | <small>18%</small> |
| <small>- Emerging countries</small>        |  <small>5%</small> |  <small>5%</small> |
| <small>- Real estate & dividend</small>    | <small>15%</small> | <small>10%</small> |
| Bonds                                      |        20%         |        15%         |
| Commodities                                |        10%         |        10%         |
| Crypto                                     |        10%         |        15%         |
{:.right-figures}

Within bonds and _real estate & dividend_ stocks, I also diversify geographically.
In early 2021, I made my allocations more growth aggressive by reducing bonds by 5% and increasing crypto by the same amount.
This increase in crypto was also as I did more research and found many (40+) crypto tokens that I would like exposure to.
I reduced _real estate & dividend_ stocks because they are not my priority right now and I have to pay 30% tax on all dividend (even if not withdrawn).
