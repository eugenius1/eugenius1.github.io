It's March 2020 and the stock market is taking a nose dive (pictured above on the right) due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
My digital bank [Revolut](https://revolut.com/referral/eusebi8t3!ASO) adds the ability to buy stocks.
That's when I got into stocks and investing.
But the best of all of this has been understanding personal finance and taking it more seriously.

**Personal finance** and managing your money is a really important part of life that, at least from my experience,
isn't really taught in schools and is rarely discussed in close circles.
So if this info isn't passed down from your parents, you fall behind on financial literacy.
Furthermore, financial wellness is more determined by **how you manage** your money than simply your income.

Saving & investing are pillars of good personal finance.
**Investing** is making money work for you in the **medium- to long-term**.
It is **not** a get-rich-quick scheme.
In this series, I share my investing journey.

## Learning

Most of my learning on investing and personal finance has been from YouTube and supplemented by my own internet searches.
I've made a [**YouTube playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJr1hnSQ56-a-lTrZNwUIWr24fJiU6EJo)
with all the videos that I've found helpful, sorted from basics to more advanced topics.
If you're new to investing I **highly recommend** watching at least the first 2 videos. Pro tip: I watch at 1.5x speed or faster.

I've also made this [succinct summary](/projects/investing/playlists/investing) of the playlist that you can use to jump to topics that may interest you.
I follow the channels/accounts below (and you may see them a lot in my playlist because their content is gold).
What you should keep in mind is they're all in the US so some things like tax may be different for you where you live.

### Short recap

**Asset**:
Something that can be bought with the hope of future profit and/or income. Common examples include stocks, bonds, real estate, currencies and commodities like gold.

**Liability**:
Something that makes you lose money, such as debt or a car (especially a brand new Lamborghini)

**Trading vs investing**:
Generally, trading is short-term buying and selling for profit while investing means holding assets over a longer time (think years).
Trading takes a lot of time and skill, similar to a job, and you're up against (institutional) traders with a lot of money, skill, experience and algorithms.

**Inflation**:
Things costing more money over time due to the decline of a currency's purchasing power.
For example, $100 today can buy less things than $100 10 years ago.

**Stock**:
An asset representing ownership of a fraction of a company.
Units of stock are _shares_.
As a shareholder, you can even vote on some company decisions (depending on your broker)!

**Dividend**:
Some companies use some of their profits to reward their shareholders every few months or every year.

**Index fund**:
This allows investing in a single, pooled basket of different assets that track an index, e.g. the top 500 US companies (_S&P 500_) or a specific industry like real estate, instead of having to buy individual company stocks.

**Mutual fund**:
Like an index fund but the basket of assets is actively managed (selected) by a team of people instead of the selection being made objectively by an index.
These funds tend to have higher fees than index funds.

**ETF** (Exchange-Traded Fund):
A single basket of assets that can be bought and sold just like a stock and it's price moves up and down many times in a trading day.

**Bond**:
Owning a bond means being the lender to a borrower, typically governments or companies wanting to finance projects or operations.
Usually, the borrower pays interest (annually or more frequent) to the lender/bond owner.

**Commodity**:
A natural/scarce resource like gold or oil, or agricultural product like wheat, or even livestock animals.

### Mindset

**Markets are emotional**:
Asset prices are fundamentally driven by human emotion and the dynamics of supply and demand.
Many people buy assets with **greed/FOMO** (Fear Of Missing Out) when prices are shooting up,
and panic sell with **fear** when prices are going down.
Places like the stock market are the only places where people run away when prices come down (a good investor sees a **sale**),
and people want to buy more when prices go up.

A major key to remember is that investing (medium- to long-term) means going through multiple market cycles and their ups and downs.

Time

## 1st: Eliminating bad debt

Debt is an inevitable part of life, be it student loans or home mortgage, but some are far worse than others to have.
They can also affect your [credit score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score) in different ways.

3-5%

## 2nd: Emergency fund

At the same time as making a plan to eliminate bad debt (if any), a plan should also be made for your emergency fund.

1. Liquidity: Cash in a bank account for emergencies
2. Avoid selling investments and let investments compound over time

## 3rd: Financial goals

After figuring

Risk

Wealth accumulation/growth then wealth preservation

Align your financial goals with your investments 

## 4th: Active or passive?

With financial goals set, the next step is to figure out time and effort commitment.

## 5th: Taxable or non-taxable account?

## 6th: Asset classes

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Commodities
- Cryptocurrencies aka cryptos

Crypto: young, volatile, still evolving, very speculative right now
