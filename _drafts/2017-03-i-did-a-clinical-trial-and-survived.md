**<abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>**: I had a good experience and got money that covered my lacking student finance but rightly so, clinical trials are not for everyone.

Yesterday, I successfully completed day 57 after being injected with single dose of a study drug. This is the first brief I received

> The study drug being developed in this study is a compound called benralizumab for the **treatment of asthma**. This is a first time into man study. This study consists of **1 night in–house and 9 outpatients visits**. We are looking for **healthy male** volunteers (aged 18-55). Volunteers must be non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to screening. The inconvenience allowance for this study is **£1,700**.

# Screening

man got ill, bed-ridden. His food was brought to his bed

# In-house visit

more men than women. Women who do are mostly post child bearing age.

# Outpatient visits

man who stopped the trial

# What I discovered

I'm quite a healthy man.
